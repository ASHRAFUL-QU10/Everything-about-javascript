/*
Example 1:
Input: patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
- "a" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "abc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "bc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".
3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.

Example 2:
Input: patterns = ["a","b","c"], word = "aaaaabbbbb"
Output: 2
Explanation:
- "a" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
- "b" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
- "c" does not appear as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.

Example 3:
Input: patterns = ["a","a","a"], word = "ab"
Output: 3
Explanation: Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word "ab".
