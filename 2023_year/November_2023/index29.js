/*
Given a balanced parentheses string s, return the score of the string.

The score of a balanced parentheses string is based on the following rule:

"()" has score 1.
AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
(A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.
*/


/*
Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: s = "(())"
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: s = "()()"
Output: 2

/*
Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 50
s consists of only '(' and ')'.
s is a balanced parentheses string.
